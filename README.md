## Overview 

I am currently a student and software developer in the making. This was a required project for my course, the point of this project was to learn how to design the back end for a web-based application by creating my own Docker Images/Containers, using a Django framework, and then deploying it to the cloud. I chose to do the back end of a video game because game development is something I am interested in currently.
